# guidomia

This app is a take home project requested by Bell Canada, Inc.

The list of requirements and assets to use are included inside Guidomia-Requirements-and-Assets zip file

Some notes:
- On purpose, I did not follow the UI to the exact detail. For example, I used primary and secondary colors as much as possible so the app can look good on both like and dark mode by default. The rows are not using light gray background but system primary so it works well on both modes

- App is set in portrait mode only for iPhone, and it was not designed for iPad use

- Implemented using VIPER architecture, and using abstraction with testing in mind
